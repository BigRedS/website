Software, as recommended by Avi
================================

Here's a list I keep promising to make. It's of useful software I have recommended or would recommend to people. Most of it's available for Windows.


Productivity
------------

### Mail clients

* [Thunderbird](http://en-gb.www.mozillamessaging.com/en-GB/thunderbird) is easy-to-use and full of Mozilla goodness.
* [Claws Mail](http://www.claws-mail.org/) is powerful and reasonably lightweight. It's based on the more awesome but less stable [http://sylpheed.sraoss.jp/en/ Sylpheed/:

### Office Suites
* [OpenOffice.org](http://openoffice.org) is the default free Office suite. It's mostly feature-complete with respect to MS office, and as of version 3.2 can do OOXML (*.docx, *.xlsx etc.) files if you're into that kind of thing.
* [AbiWord](http://www.abisource.com/) and [gnumeric](http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/downloads.shtml) are the Gnome office suite and significantly lighter than OpenOffice.org.
* [IBM Symphony](http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/home.nsf/home) is IBM's fork of OpenOffice.org, and is basically a bit prettier and lighter.

### Drawing/graphing 
* [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/) vector graphics editor. 
* [dia](http://projects.gnome.org/dia/) is brilliant for diagrams. Flowcharts, circuit diagrams, db schema etc.
* [GNUPlot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) makes graphing stuff really easy.
* [RRDTool](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/) more feature-complete but less simple than gnuplot.
* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) works magic on images. Pretty much anything can be done to anything.

Utilities
---------

### System un-buggering
* [System Rescue CD](http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page) is about the benchmark. Small, light, feature-rich and brilliant in most ways.
* [Damn Small Linux](http://www.damsmalllinux.org/) is smaller and more usable-system orientated than SysRescCD. It works much better as a day-to-day OS than system rescue CD.
* [Knoppix](http://www.knoppix.net/) is either the inventor of the LiveCD or the one that made them popular. Somehow makes KDE run entirely in ram without inciting violence. Also good for fixing stuff.

### Monitoring
* [MRTG](http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/) is a lightweight perl-based snmp client which graphs bandwidth usage.
* [Munin](http://munin.projects.linpro.no/) provides a web interface and a whole bunch of graphs. Really easy to write plugins for. Multiple munin installations can be joined into the same interface, with overlaid graphs. Also supports snmp.
* [Cacti](http://www.cacti.net/) is like a prettier, more feature-complete, harder-to-write-plugins-for munin.

### Anti-virus and security
* [Clam Antivirus](http://www.clamav.net/) is the de-facto standard Win32 antivirus tool for *nixen. It's designed to sit on a server and monitor files moving through it. Can be tied into most mailservers.
* [HijackThis](http://free.antivirus.com/hijackthis/) is a reporting tool. It doesn't fix much, but provides detailled reports to help fix things. Registry changes, autoloading files, hidden processes, that kind of thing.
* [Avast!](http://www.avast.com/en-gb/index) Anti-virus
* [Spybot S&D](http://www.safer-networking.org/index2.html) for unearthing spyware.
* [Ad-Aware](http://www.lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware.php) for adware. Spybot + Ad-Aware tends to be a good combination.
